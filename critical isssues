1. Scale:
    Different assets come in:
        different unit systems (cm, m, inches, arbitrary)
        different authoring scales
        sometimes already scaled inside file
        sometimes nested under scaled parents
    
    Solution: Normalize every asset using real-world size references stored in the asset manifest.
