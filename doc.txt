- Tried generating walk animation logic directly via LLM-generated Blender Python script.
- Result: Failed.
- Issues:

  - Script assumed object names / armature structure that didn’t exist.
  - Keyframes were written to wrong data blocks.
  - Camera + scene context errors.
- Conclusion: LLM-generated animation-from-scratch is unreliable without tight constraints.

> 2

- Pivot decision: Stop asking LLM to invent animation logic.
- New approach: Use existing walk animation template + programmatically modify transforms (location, timing, camera).

- Imported parking lot GLTF.
- Fixed scale and alignment manually in viewport.
- Verified character, car, and environment scale consistency.

> 4

- Goal refined:

  - Character starts a short distance away.
  - Walks toward the car.
  - Side-view camera framing entire action.

> 5

- Used Blender viewport playback instead of rendering to iterate faster.
- Confirmed animation timing and positioning visually.

> 6

- Wrote minimal Python script to:

  - Move character root object toward target position (near car).
  - Adjust animation start/end frames.
  - Avoid operators that require UI context.
